# Multiuser Portfolio

I have personally built this project to highlight my career background and showcase my skills and other relevant information. Well, the cool feature of this project is that
it is multiuser based. And what I mean by multiuser is, any user can sign up and build their own portfolio with the specific theme/ui I have provided by updating their own personal
information and skills.

I have shown my portfolio by default but when a user will sign up and build their own they can then have their own profile and get a direct public link by the specific url and
search for all available users' profile/portfolio who will be using this system.

I have deployed the project on pythonanywhere. You can view the full app on this link [nabilmoiun.pythonanywhere.com/portfolio/](http://nabilmoiun.pythonanywhere.com/portfolio/)
to check out my work and create your own profile by using it.
